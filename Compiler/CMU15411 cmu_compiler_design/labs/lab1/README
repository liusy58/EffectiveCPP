Lab 1 Handout

doc/       -- lab specification
sml/       -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in SML
           -- if you'd like to use this as your starting point, do
              % svn copy sml compiler
           -- to get a private copy
java/      -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in Java
           -- if you'd like to use this as your starting point, do
              % svn copy java compiler
           -- to get a private copy
tests0/    -- some provided test files
driver/    -- driver files (almost) identical to those on Autolab
           -- test your copiler with
              % ./driver.pl file1.l1 file2.l1 ...
runtime/   -- runtime environment for generated assembly
           -- generate executable with
	      % gcc -m64 <testfile>.s l1rt.c

To be created (details see doc/lab1.pdf):

tests/     -- directory with your own test file *.l1
compiler/  -- directory with your own compiler
