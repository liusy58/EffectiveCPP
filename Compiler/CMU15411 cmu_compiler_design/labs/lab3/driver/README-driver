This director contains the driver.  The driver can be
used to test your compiler, and it is also used by the
Autolab server to evaluate your code.  This handout is the
same for lab2tests and lab2, which are merely two phases
of the same lab.

You can obtain the driver, runtime system, and writeup
with

  svn checkout https://cvs.concert.cs.cmu.edu/15411-f09/<team>/lab3

or do

  svn update

while in the 15411-f09/<team> directory.

Copy the driver files to the directory where your compiler is

% cp driver/* compiler/
% cp runtime/* compiler/

Now you can call the driver as in

% cd compiler
% ./driver.pl [-h] [-u userid] [-d n] [-s] [-t] [-f] files...

  -h           prints help
  -u userid    sends result to autolab server as userid
  -d n         set debug level to n (default 0)
  -s           skip generation of compiler
  -t           validate test files instead of testing compiler
  -f           check test files with reference compiler
  files...     test files

If you omit the test files, they default to

../tests0/*.l2 ../tests1/*.l2
               for testing your compiler with the standard suites

../tests/*.l2  for validating your test files (-t).  Since you
	       don't have our reference compiler, this is of limited
               use until you have your own compiler.

                A better approach is ./driver.pl -f ../tests/*.l2

If you omit the test files and give the -u userid flag, a progress
report summary will be sent to Autolab as an "unofficial handin".  In
order to receive credit, you need to officially hand via tests/
and compiler/ via Autolab.
