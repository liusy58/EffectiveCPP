### Systems Architecture

#### Assembly 


#### Atomic Operations

???+note "atomic operation"
    An operation is atomic if no other processor should interrupt it. If an instruction is atomic, it makes sure that only one processor or thread performs any intermediate step at a time. 


#### Hyperthreading

???+note "hyperthreading"
    Hyperthreading allows one physical core to appear as many virtual cores to the operating system.
