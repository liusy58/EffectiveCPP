This directory contains the driver files for testing your compiler.
The Autolab server uses an (almost) identical driver files to grade
your code upon hand-in.

We suggest you copy the driver files to the directory where you are
implementing your compiler.

% cp -p driver/* compiler/

Now you can call the driver as in

% cd compiler
% ./driver.pl [-h] [-u userid] [-d n] [-s] [-t] [-f] files...

  -h           prints help
  -u userid    sends result to autolab server as userid
  -d n         set debug level to n (default 0)
  -s           skip generation of compiler
  -t           validate test files instead of testing compiler
  -f           check test files with reference compiler
  files...     test files

If you omit the test files, they default to

../tests0/*.l1 ../tests1/*.l1
               for testing your compiler with the standard suites

../tests/*.l1  for validating your test files (-t).  Since you
	       don't have our reference compiler, this is of limited
               use until you have your own compiler

If you omit the test files and give the -u userid flag, a progress
report summary will be sent to Autolab as an "unofficial handin".  In
order to receive credit, you need to officially hand in tests/
and compiler/ via Autolab.
