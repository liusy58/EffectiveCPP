#test return 0

# The idea here is that if you choose a number n, with three digits,
# after manipulations you will always get back the same number.  It is
# a fun trick to play on kids so that they think that you are psychic.
# (Actually, the number can be an arbitrary number of digits, but if you
# tell a kid to type in a three digit number, and type it in again,
# (s)he will see the number multiplied by 1001).
# This will return 0 for arbitrary n.
