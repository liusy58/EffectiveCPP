Lab 4 Handout

doc/       -- lab specification
tests0/    -- some provided test files
tests1/    -- some more provided test files (added later)
runtime/   -- runtime environment for generated assembly
           -- generate executable with
	      % gcc -m64 -O2 <testfile>.s l4rt.c
driver/    -- driver used by autolab, use for testing

To be created (details see doc/lab4.pdf):

tests/     -- directory with your own test file *.l4
compiler/  -- directory with your own compiler

We recommend to copy driver and runtime into your
compiler directory.

cp driver/* runtime/* compiler/

See README-driver for more info on driver.
