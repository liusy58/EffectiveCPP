???+info "bang mechanism"
    The VM handles stack overflow by framing the stack arena with inaccessible guard pages, and intercepting the accesses to those guard pages to detect the case where a stack overflow occurred. That also requires and additional logic of actually probing the stack when putting a new activation record on it: by touching the stack down trying to trigger the guard page fault. This mechanism has a fancy name of "stack banging", and if we want to do anything below stack pointer, we need to communicate the additional banging to the runtime.
