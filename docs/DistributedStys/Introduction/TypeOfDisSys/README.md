We make a distinction between distributed computing systems, distributed information systems, and pervasive systems. 

???+note "cluster computing vs. grid computing vs. cloud computing "
    In cluster computing, the underlying hardware consists of a collection of similar workstations or PCs connected by LAN. But in grid computing, the subgroup consists of distributed systems that are different when it comes to hardware, software, and deployed network technology. As for cloud computing, it provides the facilities to dynamically construct an infras
